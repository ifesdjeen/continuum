# Continuum

Continuum is a (prototype) of a time-series store with ad-hoc query capabilities.

The implementation is based on the following papers:

  * Compression: [Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf)
  * Querying: [From Streams to lists to nothing at all](http://code.haskell.org/~dons/papers/icfp088-coutts.pdf)
  * Querying: [General Incremental Sliding-Window Aggregation](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p702-tangwongsan.pdf)
