## Concurrency Model

All incoming aggregations are being put into STM buffer, and reduced
until they're flushed.

All the data is stored in buckets, that are similar to virtual nodes.
Each chunk is holding up to an hour worth of data points.

## Cluster

### Sharding

Data is sharded based on the time.

## Building Hyperleveldb:

```
git clone --depth=50 --branch=master git://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB.git hyperleveldb
cd hyperleveldb
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
ldconfig
```
